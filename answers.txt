What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a Git repository that is hosted 
on a server, which can be accessed and used by multiple 
developers over the internet or a network. It is a centralized 
location for storing the project's code and allows developers 
to collaborate on the same codebase by pushing and pulling 
changes to and from the remote repository.
