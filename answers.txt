What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merging and rebasing are two ways to incorporate 
changes from one branch into another in Git. Merging 
creates a new commit and preserves the branch history, 
while rebasing rewrites the branch history and creates 
a linear sequence of commits.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a Git repository that is hosted 
on a server, which can be accessed and used by multiple 
developers over the internet or a network. It is a centralized 
location for storing the project's code and allows developers 
to collaborate on the same codebase by pushing and pulling 
changes to and from the remote repository.
